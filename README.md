# Mountain Topper SOTA GoBox
This project contains the necessary files and assembly instructions for turning the Mountain Topper MTR-5B QRP transceiver into a all-in-one unit for quick deployment and operation in the outdoors, namely for SOTA activations.

**Note:** This is work-in-progress. I will remove this message when the materials are ready for use.
